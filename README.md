This project describes the development of an online coffee shop application, "Chill Coffee," built using Microsoft Excel, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), and UserForms. 
The application provides a user-friendly online ordering system for customers, allowing them to browse products, manage their carts, and complete checkout securely. A key 
feature is a robust membership system offering discounts to incentivize loyalty. The staff interface, implemented using Excel spreadsheets and VBA, leverages UserForms 
for data entry and analysis. VBA is used to generate pivot tables and charts from sales data, providing valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and product 
performance. This data-driven approach allows for informed decision-making regarding marketing campaigns, inventory management, and product promotion. The application 
aims to improve operational efficiency, enhance the customer experience, and provide a strong return on investment for stakeholders. The Excel workbook serves as the 
application's database and reporting engine, powered by VBA for automation and analysis.
